# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

* Watched the Week 0 live instruction video, followed along and created the conceptual diagram (identical to the one in the video) for Cruddur in Lucid. Added some services I'm familiar with that could be used. https://lucid.app/lucidchart/96e237a1-fe17-42cb-a8a4-951432b1a03b/edit?viewport_loc=-1507%2C-431%2C4967%2C2578%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_a2a9d9f5-8150-4155-bd89-36e4d1e1acf1
