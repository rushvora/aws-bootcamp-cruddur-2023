# Week 0 — Billing and Architecture

* Watched the Week 0 live instruction video, followed along and created the conceptual diagram (identical to the one in the video) for Cruddur in Lucid. Added some services I'm familiar with that could be used. https://lucid.app/lucidchart/96e237a1-fe17-42cb-a8a4-951432b1a03b/edit?viewport_loc=-1507%2C-431%2C4967%2C2578%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_a2a9d9f5-8150-4155-bd89-36e4d1e1acf1
* Followed along with the Pricing Basics and Free tier video by Chirag Nayyar. I set up a Cloudwatch billing alarm, made sure it was setup in the us-east-1 region, and confirmed the SNS subscription to my email. I set up the monthly cost budget as well.
* Learnt about utilising tags assigned to AWS resource to potentially categorise resource costs by a defined metric. I read more about the cost allocation tags feature in the AWS docs here — https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html
